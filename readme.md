# Learn Kubernetes

This is my notes and examples made while learning kubernetes. 

Feel free to use it as you like, suggestions are welcome.

## Usage

Every XX_aaaa folder has a run.sh which runs the example. To run only a subset of 
commands in example, then try `./run.sh help` to see commands
 
## Note: 

Basic knowledge of Linux, Docker is required

All examples are meant to run on minikube

## Examples
 
* [Basic kubernetes](01_kubectl)
